 #  Work Day Scheduler

## Description

 this is a  simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. made by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

 I  used the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. 



 I am very busy employee and I need to  add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


### The app perform.
 
I am using a daily planner to create a schedule. open the planner and the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. scroll down & presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.  view the timeblocks for that day,each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. click into a timeblock and enter an event
 click the save button for that timeblock THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage, refresh the page butthe saved events persist.
